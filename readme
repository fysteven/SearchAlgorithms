There may be some problems when "make" the files after the first time.
So, please use "make clean" to make sure there is no such a problem.

However, the files I upload is completely OKAY, when I use 
"javac agent.java"
and
"java agent".

The UCS, BFS, and UCS are almost the same algorithm process except the data structure "open" which is used for storing in different ways.

In UCS, I use priority queue, which makes sure that the order of its content is measured by path cost, and then by alphabetics.

In BFS, the order of contents of the priority queue is by node depth and, then, alphabetical.

In DFS, the order of that is by node depth and then alphabetical, but is is decreasingly.

The general process in this program is as following:

Read the "intput.txt" file into the program and analyze it.

Store sections of people's information such as name, id number, and depth and the matrix of people's connection relationships.

Execute the algorithm according to the method which is from input.txt.

In my program, I store the information of people into the data structre in a Java Class, which is called "Vertex".


Output all the solution which includes the path cost, the expansion process of nodes, and the shortest path.

Apology about the late submission. I should have started to do this homework earlier.
